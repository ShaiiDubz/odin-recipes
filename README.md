# odin-recipes
My first project in Foundation called Recipes.

This was a fun little project to build a food recipes website. I learned a lot about Git and GitHub as I committed often, usually after a page was created and linked to index.html. I got to practice writing good commit comments.

I got to implement everything I learned up to this point, like, boilerplates, headings, paragraphs, alt text, images, links, lists.
