        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is another family favorite at the carnival. You will prefer this over plain fashioned popcorn.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1/2 cup unpopped popcorn kernels</li>
                <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in popcorn kernels and sugar.</li>
                <li>Cover and shake the pot constantly to prevent sugar from burning. When popping has slowed to once every 2-3 seconds, remove the pot from the heat and shake for a few minutes until popping stops.</li>
                <li>Pour popcorn into a large bowl and allow to cool, stirring occasionally to break up large clumps.</li>
        </ol>
